# Center for Internet Securitys (CIS)

CIS is a framework or set of actions developed by the Global IT community that includes a set of actions and best practices to keep an organizations cybersecurity posture at it best. 

Its also referenced in other major cybersecurity frameworks like NIST or HIPPA and acts as an umbrella framework that helps guides organizations with supported methodologies.

There are 18 CIS controls in total:


### CIS # 1 Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets:

To help prevent unauthorized devices on the organizations network, it is recommended to have a comprehensive inventory system in place that keeps track of all assets like desktops, Laptops, Mobile devices, etc. This will help IT staff notice any suspicious devices on the organizations network.

### CIS # 2 Inventory and Control of software Assets

Application inventory and management software should be utilized in an organization by means of tracking approved software, ensure patching of approved software with latest patches from software vendor, and addressing unapproved software detected. Furthermore, an organization should also utilized application whitelisting software.

### CIS # 3 Data Protection

The practice of classifying data based on sensitivity, maintain inventory of sensitive information, remove unnecessary data not used by organization. It is highly recommended that the organization should encrypt the hardware of all mobile devices and log access to all sensitive data repositories.  

### CIS # 4 Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software

A practice of establishing a secure configuration process (encrypting, logging, etc) of all assets and software. Also automatic session locking where applicable, maintaining firewall around organizations servers, managing all assets and software, and uninstalling unnecessary services and software.

### CIS # 5 Account Management

Practice of maintaining an inventory of accounts (active directory), using unique passwords, disable default/dormant accounts (guest account, local admin account), restrict admin access to dedicated admin functions, and maintain an inventory of service accounts.

### CIS # 6 Access Control Management 

Practice of establishing a access granting process (Ticketing system), an access revoking process (off boarding), MFA for externally used apps, MFA for admin access, maintain an inventory of authentication and authorized users and systems, implement a role-based access control.

### CIS # 7 Continuous Vulnerability Management

Practice of implementing a vulnerability detection and remediation process, and performing automated patch management (MECM/Intune) for OS and applications.
\
### CIS # 8 Audit Log Management

Should Establish and maintain an audit log management process, standardize time syncs, collected detailed audit logs, ensure adequate audit log storage

### CIS # 9 Email and Web Browser Protections

Use Only fully supported browser and email clients, use DNS filtering services, enforce URL filters via network level, restrict browser and email client extensions, implement DMARC, block unnecessary file types, and deploy and maintain email server anti-malware protections

### CIS # 10 Malware Defenses 

Deploy and maintain anti-malware software, disable autorun for removable media, configure auto scan for antivirus software, centrally manage anti-malware software

### CIS # 11 Data Recovery

Practice of maintaining a recovery process on critical data in the organization. This includes regular backups, protection of the data backups (store offsite or in the cloud), and regularly test the recovery of data.

### CIS # 12 Network Infrastructure Management

Configure and maintain a secure network infrastructure using secure network methodologies and communication protocols, and establish and maintain architecture diagrams.

### CIS # 13 Network Monitoring and Defense

Recommendations of creating a central security alert system (orion or pal alto), installing and maintaining IDS and IPS, collect and filter network traffic flow logs, manage access control for remote assets, and implement application level filtering.

### CIS # 14 Security Awareness and Skills Training

Preforming skills gap analysis and train employees in skills to help with phishing attacks and accidental data exposure, implementing security awareness programs.

### CIS # 15 Service Provider Management

While working with 3rd party vendors and providers, its important to ensure that they all are identified and assessed properly, ensure that they know the organizations security requirements. the Organization should also constantly monitor and properly decommission them.

### CIS # 16 Application Software Security

Its it recommended to establish a security life cycle of in-house developed, hosted, or acquired software. This would entail creating a secure application development process, taking inventory of all applications the organization uses, make sure they are kept up to date, us a rating on how secure they are, train employees to create apps securely, apply security principles in design, and implement security tests and conduct pen testing and threat modeling.

### CIS # 17 Incident Response and Management

Design and assign a Team to manage any incident handling, create a list of all department or entities that needs to be informed of a bad actor or breach incident, have a reporting system in place, conduct simulations, and conduct post-incident reviews.

### CIS # 18 Penetration Testing

Establish and maintain a penetration testing program, perform at least annual external penetration testing, remediate pen test findings, validate security measures, and preform internal pen testing.
