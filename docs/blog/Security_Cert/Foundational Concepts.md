### CIA Triad

- **Confidentiality**: Keeping data secret or access controls.
- **Integrity**: Ensuring data is not altered without authorization.
- **Availability**: Ensuring data and services are accessible when needed.

Key Takeaway on this is all cybersecurity attacks violates at least one part of the CIA Triad. For example, The **Equifax data breach** that occured in 2017, violated **Confidentiality** and the **Integrity** components.

### AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)

- **Identification**: Stating who you are, like a username.
- **Authentication**: Proving your identity (e.g., password, MFA).
- **Authorization**: Granting access to resources based on identity.
- **Accounting**: Logging and tracking actions performed by users.

### Three States of Data
- **Data in Transit**: Data moving across a network (e.g., emails, downloads).
- **Data at Rest**: Stored data (e.g., database files, hard drives).
- **Data in Use**: Data actively being processed (e.g., in memory/RAM).

An example of this is the formula E racing scandal where tire **data** in use was intercepted, showing why securing live data matters. More this scandal can be read [here](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/24/23772725/formula-e-ds-penske-rfid-tire-data-wireless-scanner).

### Non-Repudiation
- Assurance that the sender of information cannot deny sending it.
- Achieved using digital signatures and public key cryptography.
- Example Digitally signed contracts provide proof of origin and authenticity.

### Gap Analysis
- Identifying the difference between current security measures and desired security standards.
- Used to find vulnerabilities and areas needing improvement.

### Vulnerabilities, Threats, and Risks
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness (e.g., reliance on electricity for a server).
- **Threat**: Something that could exploit a vulnerability (e.g., a hacker, power outage).
- **Risk**: The measured likelihood and impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.

### Data Sovereignty
- Concept that user data is subject to the laws and protections of the user’s country, even if the data is stored elsewhere.
- Example: GDPR ensures European citizens’ data is protected globally, not just inside the EU.
