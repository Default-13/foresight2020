# Progress of Cert

## The starting line

So far, I've only used summarization tools provided by AI, answering general questions, and created flash cards based on output that includes relevant vocab in the world of cybersecurity. 

Eventually I'd love to keep up with the greats like [John Hammond](https://www.youtube.com/@_JohnHammond), doing bug bounties, and participating in CTF events. But as they say, "You have to walk before you can run". 

To at least get the foundation going in with some structure, I've decided to take a course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/comptia-security-701)
